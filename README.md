### Hello friend! ðŸ‘‹

My name's Ananya (it means "unique" in Kannada) but many of my friends call me Nani! I am a queer Desi-American creative currently based in California. At the moment, I am studying Information Systems at Carnegie Mellon University, with minors in Computer Science and Media Design. I have a love for creating and I strive to make stuff that sparks both joy and wonder in the hearts of others!

When I'm not drawing, you can usually find me making music on my ukulele, gushing over food, or rewatching episodes of Avatar: The Last Airbender.
